# This is a simple Python CLI that hashes, encrypts and decrypts a string and a file
# Options are single hash, default hash and custom hash

# For single hash, just choose in the option if you want SHA-256 or SHA-512 and it will hash it using SHA-256 or SHA-512

# For default hash, just choose in the option if you want SHA-256 or SHA-512 and it will hash it 10 times since default is 10 hashing times

# For custom hash, just choose in the option if you want SHA-256 or SHA-512 and enter how many times it will hash it and it will hash it based on what number you've inputted. The CLI will throw an error if you input a number lower than 20, it must always be higher than 20 or else it will just hash it 20 times.

# The CLI can also encrypt and decrypt files. Please keep the key secure as it only uses Symmetric encryption/decryption.

# The purpose of the CLI is rather for personal and private individual use than for public/enterprise use. The purpose is to hash and/or encrypt passwords stored in plain text in a local host or a.k.a you're laptop#
